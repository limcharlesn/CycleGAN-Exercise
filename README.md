# CycleGAN-Exercise
This project is an exercise within Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

The objective of the exercise is to train generators within a CycleGAN to allow image to image translation.
The architecture used within this exercise is a 5-layer convolutional net for the Discriminators, an encoder (3 convolutional layers)-residual block (3 residual blocks)-decoder (3 convolutional layers) net for the Generators.
